# Search-Engine
• Implemented linear, index-based, hashtable-based search to search through 4500 files for the file with a search keyword.  
• Displayed search results using HTML and jinja2 template.  
• Note: My professor would like me to keep my project code private. Please feel free to email me at cpang6@usfca.edu and I will be happy to send a zip file of my code.
